## Installation Instruction
In order to run the game from source code, you will need to install the Godot Game Engine 3.1-stable from their site 
https://godotengine.org/

Once downloaded, extract the executible file into the root folder of the game and run the executible. That is all you will need to run the game.

To edit or develop the game, you will need to extract godot to a different folder, run the executible and in the project selector view,
select import project. Then go to the game's root directory and select the project.godot file.

That is all you need to get started with this game's source codes.

If the game cannot resolve the dependencies, just redirect it to the necessary files again in disk.

You will also need a PC with minimum OpenGL 3 support and a decent GPU.
